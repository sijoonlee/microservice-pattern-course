Source code on the course uses spring boot 2.2.x.


# Spring Boot 2.3.x Notes
Start from Spring Boot 2.3.0, Spring validation starter no longer includes validator.
If you intend to use Spring Boot 2.3.x, add the following dependency on build.gradle on project microservice-pattern-two and microservice-pattern-three

    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-validation'


# Newest is not always best
There are many components involved on spring boot microservices.
The course uses compatible libraries and it works as you seen on videos.

Based on my personal experience, some features on newest version might not always works as expected (maybe due to bug on the libraries).
On my professional experience, I ever encounter problem connecting to service discovery (consul) because library version update.

Always test your application!
